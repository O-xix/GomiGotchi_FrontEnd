# GomiGotchi – Frontend (UWB Hacks 2025)

This repository contains the **frontend prototype** for **GomiGotchi**, a gamified litter-cleanup mobile app created during **UWB Hacks 2025** (theme: *Save the World*).  

## 📖 Project Overview
GomiGotchi combines **game design** with **environmental action** to encourage people to pick up litter in public.  
- Users are paired with a digital pet (“GomiGotchi”) that stays happy and fed through real-world trash pickups.  
- The frontend tracks cleanup activity and provides interactive feedback through maps and a pet dashboard.  
- Designed to make picking up litter in public feel **rewarding and approachable**.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **React** – frontend framework  
- **Leaflet.js** – mapping and geolocation features  
- **Tailwind CSS** – styling and UI design  
- **Framer Motion** – animations and interactions  

## 📝 Features (Prototype)
- Map view for tracking cleanup activity  
- Pet dashboard that reflects user actions  
- Basic gamification elements (feeding the pet through litter cleanup)  
- Integration-ready frontend for backend data  

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Frontend development with **React** and modern JS libraries  
- Map integration and geolocation using **Leaflet.js**  
- UI/UX design with **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion**  
- Rapid prototyping in a **hackathon** environment  
- Team collaboration and product ideation  

## 📌 Note
This repo contains the **frontend prototype only**. The project was built collaboratively in a 5-person team as part of a 36-hour hackathon, and is not production-ready (yet).
